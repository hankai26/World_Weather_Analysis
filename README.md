# World Weather Analysis

This project is to create a Pandas DataFrame with hundruds of the world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data. This project did three analysis.

- The OpenWeatherMap Application Programming Interface (API) is applied to retrieve the weather data for the database from a JSON file.

- This analysis would use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. 

- From the list of potential travel destinations, four cities were selected to create a travel itinerary. The Google Maps Directions API is also used to create a travel route between the selected cities as well as a marker layer map.
